# [Tic Tac Toe](https://victorxph.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/)

Tic tac toe game project from [TOP](https://theodinproject.com)

- I've focused on building the logic first without relying in DOM elements, used modular design pattern (tried at least), to expose some private properties and methods, and get the game running properly on the console, then capture my DOM elements and create render() to interact with the DOM.
